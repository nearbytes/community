# Nearbytes Desktop

**NOTE: this content is just an AI-generated summary of a submitted project proposal. Indepentently of the proposal's outcome we will start this initiative soon by producing usable software that addresses the problems described here**.

## What

**A shared encrypted friend-to-friend writable data space which is transparent on what disks you use (private, online, public, whatever can store data is Nearbytes storage) and what channels you use (from usb sticks to e-mail to google drive as a private transitory channel!).**

Nearbytes is a privacy‑first, decentralized project focused on user‑controlled data sharing, sync, and backup. This initiative advances open, auditable technology that empowers people to keep full control of their data without platform lock‑in.


## Goal

Lower the barrier to private, user‑sovereign data sharing by delivering an open protocol and a usable desktop application that:
- Prioritizes privacy and local control
- Avoids centralized dependencies
- Contributes to the digital commons with open source code and documentation

## What this project does

- Storage‑first, transmission‑agnostic design
  - Separates storage from transport for flexibility and resilience
  - Supports diverse communication channels (e.g., local, peer‑to‑peer, relays)

- Collection‑Based Addressing (CBA)
  - Immutable, verifiable addressing for strong data integrity
  - Enables deduplication and efficient collaboration on shared data

- Friend‑to‑Friend backup
  - Opt‑in, trust‑based peer backup among contacts
  - Resilient by design without reliance on centralized services

- Practical privacy
  - End‑to‑end cryptography with keys under the user’s control
  - Usability‑focused approach so privacy features are easy to use

- Open ecosystem
  - Protocol and reference implementations developed in the open
  - Foundation for third‑party apps, tooling, and integrations

## Why it matters

- User sovereignty: You control your data, how it’s shared, and where it lives.
- Privacy by design: Cryptographic protection and local control as first principles.
- Digital commons: Open standards and code that benefit the broader community.

## How to get involved

- Watch this repository for updates and discussions.
- Open issues to share feedback, use‑cases, or feature requests.
- Contribute via pull requests (examples, docs, prototypes, tooling).
- Join community conversations through our normal Nearbytes channels.

## Roadmap highlights

- Usable desktop prototype for an initial photo‑sharing use case
- Clear APIs/SDKs for developers and integrators
- Documentation: how‑tos, security/threat model, benchmarks
- Community onboarding: workshops, tutorials, early adopters
